1. Based on accuracy which dimensionality reduction method, PCA, simulate annealing, or the genetic algorithm worked the best?
    Genetic algorithm and simulate annealing both provide 95.3% of accuracy
2. For each of the two other methods, explain why you think it did not perform as well as the best one.
    For PCA, the reason is that PCA is a non-parametric analysis and assumes the features are linearly
    correlated
3. Did the best dimensionality reduction method produce a better accuracy than using none (i.e. the results of Part 1)? Explain possible reasons why it did or did not.
    It does provide better accuracy. The reason is at the end of GA algorithm generation, you will choose best
    of 5 set, so the result will only getting better and better
4. Did Part 2 produce the same set of best features as Part 3? Explain possible reasons why it did or did not.
    No. As said before, PCA is non-parametric analysis and assumes the features are linearly
    correlated
5. Did Part 2 produce the same set of best features as Part 4? Explain possible reasons why it did or did not.
    No. PCA only transform features, we only select features that gives highest accuracy based on 4 transformed features. 
6. Did Part 3 produce the same set of best features as Part 4? Explain possible reasons why it did or did not.
    No. Althou they have the same accuracym but they are using different set. SA doesnâ€™t jump very far and may still find a sub-optimum solution, however, GA will eventually check every possible permutation of features and provide best possible solution
